## Important Notes

This game was created as part of a the UW-Milwaukee course CompSci 746 - Immersive Technologies and 3D User Interface. 
The concept of the game derives from, possibly, being showcased at Discovery World, from a theme of Halloween and 
intended audience of kids ranging from the ages of 5 to 12 years old.

This game was developed in Godot game engine and designed/tested for and with the Meta Quest 2.

This repository does not provide the entirety of the project but the scripts used to make the game functional.

This project is completed as part of the course but still a lot of room from improvements.

## Issues:

- Hands coming too close to the head may cause a glitch and require the game to restart
- The spoon snap point is small size

# Future Improvements

- Imrpove wizard guide
  - Include visual and audio feedback
- Adding more potions
- Adding a start screen
...
